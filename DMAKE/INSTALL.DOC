DMAKE Quick Installation Procedure
----------------------------------

    1. Check your LANMAN.INI file.
        Edit the 'domain' switch to specify the same domain as other DMAKE
            users. This is the domain that has the maximum number of slave
            computers and thus the best performance.
        Check to see if you have share-level security (security = share).
            The recommended security is share-level. If you use user-level
            security, see DMAKE.DOC.
        Make the 6th entry in srvheuristics 4 (srvheuristics = 1111014...).
            Entries begin with the 0th entry.
        Check that your server is visible (srvhidden = no).
        Check that your server services is a standard server
            (server = services\netsvini.exe). The server must NOT be a
            Peer server (server = services\netpsini.exe).

    2. Copy DMK.DLL and DMKV.DLL to a directory in the LIBPATH specified 
        in your CONFIG.SYS. It is recommended that you copy non-system
	dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to a separate directory (for example,
	C:\DLL) so that if you upgrade your version of MS (R) OS/2, non-MS
	OS/2 DLLs are not deleted. You may have to change the LIBPATH entry
	in your CONFIG.SYS. If so, you should reboot your computer.

    3. Copy the four executables (DMAKE, MKSLAVE, SLVSTAT, PERFMTR) to a
        directory in your PATH.

    4. Copy DMAKE.INI to your INIT environment directory. The slave program
        caches tools used for builds in a directory you specify in your
        DMAKE.INI file. Decide on a path, and then change 'Path' and
        'SyncPath' in DMAKE.INI to those values.

    5. Check to see that you have a TMP environment variable set.

At this point, you have finished installing DMAKE.

    Note: Read DMAKE.DOC to learn about DMAKE.

To use DMAKE, execute the following commands (they can be added to
your STARTUP.CMD file):

    start cpumeter
    start mkslave

You can run DMAKE instead of NMAKE. Because DMAKE uses the same syntax as
NMAKE, it can use NMAKE makefiles unchanged. Try a simple makefile and see
what happens. If you see commands preceded by text between square brackets
(for example,  [Local 1]), DMAKE is running.
