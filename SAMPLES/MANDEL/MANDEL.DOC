MANDEL User's Guide
-------------------

This file explains the MANDEL utility and MANDLSRV service. It contains the
following sections:

  1.  What is MANDEL?
  2.  What is MANDLSRV?
 

1. What is MANDEL?
------------------

  MANDEL is a Microsoft (R) Windows (TM) application that draws a
  mandelbrot picture. The calculations that produce the picture can
  be done on the local machine, or they can be distributed over a local
  area network (LAN) if there is at least one server running the MANDLSRV
  service (see the following section).
  
  To produce MANDLE.EXE, change to the MANDEL\CLIENT directory and use
  the makefile provided. The Windows SDK header files and libraries
  must be accessible.

  To run MANDEL.EXE, the LAN Manager Workstation service must be started.
  MANDEL.EXE can then be started using the Windows RUN command.

  To use the zoom facility of MANDEL.EXE, run the application then select
  the area to be expanded by clicking on a corner of the area with the
  mouse cursor. Move the cursor to the far corner of the desired area
  with the mouse key depressed and then release the key. Select the SPECIAL
  option and then select ZOOM IN. The picture will be redrawn with the
  selected area expanded. A ZOOM OUT facility has not been implemented.
  Select SPECIAL and then BACK TO TOP to redraw the initial picture.


2. What is MANDLSRV?
--------------------

  MANDLSRV is a LAN Manager service that speeds up the calculations for
  the mandelbrot picture. MANDEL.EXE searches for servers running the
  MANDLSRV service and distributes the calculations between them. Data
  is passed between the servers and the workstation
  running MANDEL.EXE via named pipes.

  To produce MANDLSRV.EXE, change to the MANDEL\SERVER directory and use
  the makefile provided. The MS (R) OS/2 Presentation Manager toolkit or
  SDK header files and libraries must be accessible.

  To install the MANDLSRV service, the server's LANMAN.INI file must contain
  the service specifier and service location. This service has no settable
  parameters. You must add the following line to the LANMAN.INI file:

      [mandlsrv]

  and you must add the following lines in the [services] section of LANMAN.INI:

      [services]
          mandlsrv = C:\MANDEL\SERVER\MANDLSRV.EXE
  
  (This example assumes that you have put MANDLSRV.EXE in the C:\MANDEL\SERVER
  directory.)

  You can now start the MANDELSRV service using the following command:

      net start mandlesrv
