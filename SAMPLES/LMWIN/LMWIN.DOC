LMWIN User's Guide
------------------

LMWIN is a Microsoft (R) Windows (TM) 3.0 application which displays
workstation information. It calls various LAN Manager API functions
and displays the resultant information on the screen.

To produce LMWIN.EXE, change to the LMWIN directory and use the makefile
provided. This makefile can be used with NMAKE.EXE or NMK.COM. The file
LOMEMORY.BAT is provided for the case when there is not enough memory
available on your system to compile the program using NMAKE or NMK. 
The Microsoft Windows 3.0 SDK header files and libraries must be
accessible.

To run LMWIN.EXE the LAN Manager workstation service must be started.
LMWIN.EXE can then be started using the Windows RUN command.
